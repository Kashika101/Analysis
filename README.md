# Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA or Exploratory Data Analysis is an approach to analyze datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. 
In other words, it is about knowing your data, gaining a certain amount of familiarity with the data, before one starts to extract insights from it. EDA is the basic pre step in order to make an efficient machine learning model with fairly good predicting power.

The insights drawn are used for answering questions and making decisions. The libraries that have been used in this project are Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn. 

The aim behind exploring this dataset is to explore the factors which are leading to high attrition rate. Insights will be presented after each visualization. The Question that I am trying to answer here is :

**WHY ARE EMPLOYEES LEAVING THE WORKPLACE?
